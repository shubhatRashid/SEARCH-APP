## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `public/`: Contains the public assets, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components, styles, and app logic.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `styles/`: Contains the stylesheets written in Tailwind CSS.

## Customization

### Styling

The app's styles are built using Tailwind CSS. You can customize the styles by editing the classes in the `styles/` directory. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more information on how to customize styles.
